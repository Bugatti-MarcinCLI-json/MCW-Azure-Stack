# Azure Stack Migrate hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack Hub consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack Hub is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to deploy and manage solutions running on Azure Stack Hub.

## Overview

Contoso Finance is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy, they are planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack Hub as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

## Solution architecture

![The Microsoft Azure Stack Hub is made up of Mortgage Applications and Mortgage Admin databases, Offerings API, Storage Queue Mortgage Applications, Mortgage Applications, and SQL Web App DB and Customer Data.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image2.png "Solution Architecture")

## Exercise 1: Create Azure Stack Hub Deployment Taxonomy for Tenants

In this exercise, you will create the subscriptions, offers, and plans that will be used by your Azure Stack Hub tenants. 

Duration: 15-30 minutes

![Screenshot of an Azure Stack Hub Deployment Taxonomy.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image69.png "Azure Stack Hub deployment")

### Task 1: Create the Deployment Taxonomy

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **AzSHOST-1**, start a browser and navigate to the **Azure Stack Admin Portal** via the desktop icon.

2. When prompted, sign in with the **AzSHOperator** account you created when following the **Before the hands-on lab guide**.

3. Select **+ Create a resource** on the left. 

4. Select **Offers + Plans** followed by **Plan**.

    ![In the Marketplace blade, Offers and Plans is selected. In the Featured Apps blade, Plan is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image70.png "Featured Apps blade")

18. Next, open a new browser tab, and navigate to Azure Stack Hub User portal and select **Get a subscription**.

    ```
    https://portal.local.azurestack.external
    ```

   ![Azure Stack Hub dashboard screenshot](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image88.png "Azure Stack Hub dashboard")

   > **Note**: This is the User portal Contoso Finance will use to provision and manage their Azure Stack Hub service.

    > **Note**: If the clipboard copy does not work, you can use the following sample text for your environment. You will need to alter this text to match your configuration.

    ```
    Data Source=sqlhost.local.cloudapp.azurestack.external,1433;Initial Catalog=ContosoFinanceWebDB;User ID=ContosoFinanceWebDB;Password=Demo\@pass123
    ```

### Task 4: Update the configuration strings

1. Navigate to your web app and on the left pane of the Web App, select **Configuration** under **Settings**.

    ![Under Settings, Application settings is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image121.png "Application settings")

2. Select **+ New application setting**. Enter the following values in the dialog that appears and select **OK**:

    ![The Connection strings fields display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image124.png "Connection strings")

6. Select **Save** on the **Configuration** page and wait for that to complete. 

### Task 5: Publish the Contoso Financial Web Application

> **Note:** The current version of the Azure Stack Hub App Service Provider does not enable the deployment center feature yet.

## Exercise 4: Automating backend processes with Azure functions 

Duration: 15-30 minutes

Contoso wants to automate the process of generating applications in PDF format by using Azure Functions. In this exercise, you will provision a Function App using the Azure Stack Hub portal. This Function App will watch the Azure Storage Queue for a message that the web application has submitted, process the application creating a PDF and storing it in Azure Blob Storage.

### Task 1: Create an Azure function to generate PDF receipts

1. From your Azure Stack Hub Host, navigate to the following repository and select **Clone**, then **Download ZIP**. After the file is downloaded, extract it to a new folder named **C:\\HoL**.

    ```
    https://github.com/opsgility/contosofinancefunction
    ```

    ![In the Azure Stack Hub Host, the Clone or download button is selected, and under Clone with HTTPS, the Download ZIP button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image139.png "Azure Stack Hub Host")

2. From the User portal, select **+ Create a resource -> Web + Mobile -> Function App**.

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 10 minutes

In this final task you will clean up the Azure Resources that you have create for the hands-on lab. This task is optional.

1.  If provisioned using the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit in an Azure VM, delete the resource group your Azure Stack Hub Host VM is running in.

2.  If running on your own Development Kit, delete all the resource groups from the Azure Stack Hub portal that you created during the execution of this lab.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
